          <h5>Overview</h5><br />Larry and Andy Wachowski have created a deeply layered philsophical and religious allegory in The Matrix trilogy.  This is a collection of references, interpretations and metaphors.  While this list is extensive, it is by no means comprehensive.<br />This is a living reference and as such, comments, questions and criticism are <a

simple rebels from the Green Matrix have digitally inspired names.<br />( Mouse, Switch, Apoc, Cypher )<br />Most simple rebels from the Blue Matrix have low-tech inspired names.<br />( Tank, Dozer, Link, Lock )<br />All primary characters have philosophical or religious names.<br /> ( Jacob, Morpheus, Trinity, Neo, Oracle, Seraph, Persephone, Merovingian )<br />All Agents have common American surnames, implying their multiplicity and conformity<br /> ( Smith, Brown, Jones -- Johnson, Jackson,Thompson )<br /><br /><b><a name="apoc">Apoc</a></b><br />In the shooting script, He is referred to as the writer of the 'Four Horseman' computer virus.<br /><br /><b><a name="architect">Architect</a></b><br />'Father of the matrix', alludes to there being a 'mother' of the matrix.  <br />Is the DemiUrge (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#gnostic_christianity">Gnostic Christianity</a>)<br />He tells Neo that his 'five predecessors were, by design, based on a similar predication' - this implies that the 5 previous 'the ones' merely all fit within a designed <i>role</i> programmed for them.  'The One' is a role, just as 'Buddha' or 'Messiah' are a role.<br /><br />The Architect is also 'father of the universe' (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#JR_Ploughman">JR Ploughman</a>)<br /><br /><b><a name="bane">Bane</a></b><br />A 'bane' is a deadly poison, a cause to harm or ruin, or a persistent annoyance.<br />Bane is the only other rebel (besides Cypher) that wears a goatee.<br />Bane is completely taken over by Smith in M2.<br /><br /><b><a name="choi">Choi</a></b><br />the purchaser of the minidisc in M1. Several of his lines are foreshadowing of Neo's fate. <br /> 'You are my savior, man. My own personal Jesus Christ.'<br /> 'This never happened. You don't exist.'<br /> 'It's called mescaline... the only way to fly' (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#doors_of_perception">Doors of Perception</a>)<br /> 'it just sounds to me like you might need to unplug'<br />Together with his companion Du Jour, they represent Neo's 'choice of the day'<br /><br /><b><a name="cypher">Cypher</a></b><br />Numerologically '0'. A word play on 'Lucifer'. <br />A Cypher is that which obscures, encrypts, or hides.<br />Cypher plays the role of Judas (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#christianity">Christianity</a>)<br />Cypher foreshadows his own desire to escape from 'reality' by being the only character to evoke the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#wizard_of_oz">Wizard of Oz</a> metaphor rather than the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#Alice_in_wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a> metaphor.<br />Cypher was the only character to wear red clothing and squared sunglasses (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#visual_clothes">Clothes</a>).<br />Cypher is the only rebel on the Neb that wears a goatee.<br />Cypher's deal with the agents echoes the sale of one's soul to the devil in exchange for earthly pleasures.<br /><br /><b><a name="deus_ex">Deus Ex Machina</a></b><br />The GodHead AI in the machine city 01.<br />from the latin Deus Ex Machina - <i>God within the machine</i>.<br />Deus Ex Machina is God ( see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#gnostic_christianity">Gnostic Christianity</a> )<br />Deus Ex Machina is the original AI, and ruler of the Earth (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#mental_monism">Mental Monism</a> )<br /><br /><b><a name="dujour">Du Jour</a></b><br />Choi's companion, bearing the white rabbit tattoo.  Together with Choi (Choix du jour: choice of the day) they represent Neo's choice.<br /><br /><b><a name="ghost">Ghost</a></b><br />alludes to the various computer terms for 'ghosting' -- chiefly to render one's computer, connection, or service invisible to detection.<br /><br /><b><a name="hamann">Hamann</a></b><br />councilor Hamann is a reference to the German philosopher Johann Hamann<br /><br /><b><a name="jacob">Jacob (of the ship Gnosis)</a></b><br />alluding to the Gnostic philosopher Jacob Boehme<br /><br /><b><a name="link">Link</a></b><br />Brother-in-law to Tank and Dozer, husband of Zee.<br />Alludes to the protagonist in a popular video game series (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>)<br /><br /><b><a name="lock">Lock</a></b><br />Commander Lock controls the hovercraft fleet and Zion defenses.<br />Possible allusion to French rebel and empiricist philosopher John Locke (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#analytic_locke">Locke</a>)<br /><br /><b><a name="merovingian">Merovingian</a></b><br />The Merovingians are a historical line of people who claim ancestry to Mary Magdalene, wife of Jesus Christ, and heavily imply they are the direct children of Christ.  During the Crusades the Merovingians adopted a religious figure known as 'The Black Madonna' which was a redesignation of the Greek Persephone. (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#JR_ploughman">JR Ploughman</a>)<br /><br />The line "I have survived your predecessors, and I will survive you.", suggest the Merovingian is a regular participant in the cyclical nature of 'The One' (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#the_one">The One</a>) and not a former 'The One' himself.<br /><br />The Merovingian is also 'Hades'(see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#greek">Greek Mythology</a>)<br /><br /><b><a name="morpheus">Morpheus</a></b><br />Greek character who could manipulate dreams and shift forms.<br />Possibly the Christian prophet 'Daniel' (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#nebuchadnezzar">Nebuchadnezzar</a>).<br />Morpheus is the captain of the Neb, and as such always enters any room first, or defers entrance to another.<br />Morpheus represents John the Baptist, and God (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#christianity">Christianity</a>)<br /><br /><b><a name="neo">Neo</a></b><br />numerologically '1'. Etymologically 'the new one'. Anagram of 'one'. <br />Neo is the Reluctant Hero (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#heroic_journey">Joseph Campbell's Heroic Journey</a>). <br />Neo is 'The One' (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#the_one">The One</a>)<br />Neo is Adam (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#gnostic_christianity">Gnostic Christianity</a>)<br />Neo is Jesus (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#christianity">Christianity</a>)<br />Neo's woolen trenchcoat with high, tight, collar carries equal parts Asiatic and religious connotation.<br />Neo is lowest in rank on the Neb (other than the added 'Link' in M2) and as such enters any room after Morpheus and Trinity.<br /><br /><b><a name="niobe">Niobe</a></b><br />Niobe represents the Greek Niobe (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#greek">Greek Mythology</a>).<br /><br /><b><a name="oracle">Oracle</a></b><br />A reference to religious Oracles in general.<br />the Oracle is the Oracle at Delphi (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#greek">Greek Mythology</a>).<br />the Oracle is also 'Eve' (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#gnostic_christianity">Gnostic Christianity</a>).<br />the Oracle is 'the Mother of the Matrix' (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#JR_Ploughman">JR Ploughman</a>)<br />As with all oracles, her answers to Neo's questions come in the form of Amphibolies, or riddles in which they have an obvious meaning which is false, and a hidden meaning which is true.<br /><br />Eg. consider her response to Neo's "[I'm waiting] for what?" -- "your next life maybe...".  The obvious, false, answer is that he isn't The One. The hidden, true, answer is that he must die and be resurrected to truly become The One.<br /><br /><b><a name="persephone">Persephone</a></b><br />Persephone is also 'Sophia' (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#gnostic_christianity">Gnostic Christianity</a>).<br />Persephone is also 'The Black Madonna' (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#merovingian">Merovingian</a>)<br />Persephone is the Greek deity 'Persephone' (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#greek">Greek Mythology</a>)<br /><br /><b><a name="rhineheart">Mr Rhineheart</a></b><br />Neo's boss at MetaCorTex.  Like Choi, Mr Rhineheart has many foreshadowing lines.<br />"You believe you are somehow special, that the rules do not apply to you"<br />"You are faced with a choice"<br />The Rhine is a river in Europe ( see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#visual_water">water</a> )<br />Rhineheart may be meant to represent Reinhardt ( see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#the_black_hole">The Black Hole</a> )<br />Neo's boss may also be named in allusion to author Luke Rhineheart ( see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#cinematic_diceman">The Dice man</a> )<br /><br /><b><a name="sati">Sati</a></b><br />The child program which is smuggled from the Machine World into the Matrix by its parents, via the train station.<br />etymologically 'righteousness'.<br />Sati is the first wife of Lord Shiva of the Hindu trinity (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#hinduism">Hindu Faith</a>).<br /><br /><b><a name="seraph">Seraph</a></b><br />Seraph is a Seraphim (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#christianity">Christianity</a>)<br />Seraph is the Gnostic Seraph ( see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#gnostic_christianity">Gnostic Christianity</a>)<br />Seraph is a program from the machine world ( see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#mental_monism">Mental Monism</a>)<br />Seraph protects "that which matters most".  As we can see, he does not always protect the Oracle - rather, he is protecting: the future.  This is why Sati is entrusted to his care.<br /><br /><b><a name="smith">Agent Smith</a></b><br />common Anglo surname; implies multiplicity.

This naming foreshadows the idea of the Matrix as an exercise in creating a human meta-cortex software package.<br />Neo receives a phone in the mail, and can hear Morpheus' voice, and is asked to trust him even though Neo cannot see him. This casts an allusion to Morpheus as 'God' (who cannot be seen, but asks to be trusted) (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#christianity">Christianity</a>)<br />Neo, isolated in his cube parallels his isolation in his pod.<br /><br /><b><a name="lafayette_hotel">Lafayette Hotel</a></b><br />This is where Neo meets Morpheus, where the rebels jack in to take Neo to the Oracle, and where they are ambushed.<br />It is arguable that this is where they plot with the Keymaker in M2.<br /><br />Marquis de Lafayette was a French General who joined the American fight for Independence.

It is the place where things are 'cooked up' - such as the rebel plot to overthrow the machines.<br />In the Oracle's kitchen a phone book sits on the refrigerator labelled "City Phone". It's in-fiction name suggests it has possible meaning, perhaps that the Oracle is connected to the rebels (who are visually represented by phones, whereas the machines use none).<br />The Oracle smokes 'Double Destiny' cigarettes.<br />This perhaps represents the two possible futures Neo must choose between, or the intertwined nature of the destiny of human and machine civilization in the resolution of the war.<br /><br /><b><a name="mainframe">Machine Mainframe</a></b><br />The ultimate data warehouse for the connection between 01 (the machine city) and the Matrix.<br />probably the home of the One True God AI in M3 (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#mental_monism">Mental Monism</a>)<br /><br /><b><a name="blank">Blank Environments</a></b><br />Virtual environments that exist outside the simulations of the green/blue matrices.<br />Eg. the backdoor hallway, the load program, Zion Mission Control, the Architect's Office, et al.<br /><br /><b><a name="architects_office">Architect's Office</a></b><br />a blank environment where the Green/Blue matrix simulations do not run.  <br />It has access to recorded events both inside the Green Matrix and the Blue Matrix. In M2 several screens during the architect's soliloquy clearly show events that happened outside the Green Matrix and away from possible video recording by sentinels; impossible without the Blue Matrix also being a simulation under the Architect's control.<br /><br />Arguably, the monitors in the Architect's Office seems to be displaying <i>past</i> occurrences of his meeting with Neo as well as <i>current</i> possible branches.  When the Architect tells Neo he is the sixth version, his alternate versions in the monitors are <i>not</i> in agreement regarding their reaction.  Some can be heard to say 'Five?', and 'Three?' just as the primary Neo says 'Six?'<br /><br />Note this seems to be inconsistent with the visual effect of the main camera diving through monitors to represent subconscious choices by Neo.  I have rewatched Reloaded and had several people (unprompted) also report hearing '5' and '3' while watching that scene.  This also does not at all mesh with the Buddhist notion of reincarnation into different forms.<br /><br />It is <i>possible</i> that one Neo is saying 'five' pondering the five who've come before him.  And the other Neo is saying '3' as if he suddenly realized the significance of the recurring numerological theme of '3'.  But that seems unlikely as cinematic characters rarely indicate they are aware of metaphoric themes they are participating within (comedies notwithstanding).<br /><br />It is possible the monitors are simply displaying <i>all</i> possible reactions of Neo, given <i>all</i> other inputs random. This including <i>what</i> the Architect says and in what tone, explaining Neo's differing emotional reactions (laughing, cursing, threatening, etc).<br /><br />The Architect's long-winded diatribe in Reloaded was spoken in amphibolies, like the Oracle's dialogue (but not quite so accessible).  The obvious, surface, interpretation is that choice is hard for machines to understand, and so they had to have some sort of an error correction system, whereby choice is allowed even though it means people can become free of the Matrix when a potential comes along to guide them.  The machines also have a garbage collection routine which removes the human concentration in the Blue Matrix/reality to help prevent the achievement of critical mass, which is becoming increasingly efficient at finding the freed humans and eradicating them.<br /><br />The deeper, (more) true, interpretation is that: human beings have free will, and can make decisions for any reason, including even <i>without</i> reason.  However, they generally make unconscious emotional and impulsive decisions, and in retrospect use ideas to consciously justify the decisions they've made.  Human beings do not tend to think freely, act freely, or have a particular grasp on what they believe, feel and know.<br /><br />This is echoed in the Oracle's statement to Neo that he cannot see past the decisions he doesn't understand.  Simply because it is only <i>after</i> Neo makes the decision that he realizes <i>why</i> he made it.  If he were acting freely then he would understand <i>why</i> he is making a decision <i>before</i> he makes it.  As Neo is a participant in the "world without time" (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#gnostic_christianity">Gnostic Christianity</a>) he essentially has already made every decision in his life, so understanding is the only thing blocking him from being able to see into the future.<br /><br />Neo knows he loves Trinity ( perhaps through machine manipulation, see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>), and he resents the machines.  Love means selfless sacrifice and hate means rebelling - so naturally when he takes the door on the right it is because he believe Love will conquer all and the machines <i>must</i> be defeated.  Of course he didn't realize <i>why</i> he took the door on the right until <i>after</i> he had made his decision.<br /><br />In M3 when Neo realizes what he must do and truly understands his purpose, he doesn't argue with Smith. He simply says "You're always right".  He does what he chooses to do without commenting on or defending his position.<br /><br />Smith, despite having gained the Eyes of the Oracle (which 'must be given'), does not understand Neo's decision to allow Smith to take him over - hence his inability to see that taking over Neo will be his ultimate end.<blockquote>Nobody can see past the choices they don't understand, even I can't<br />-- Oracle, M3</blockquote><br /><b><a name="green_matrix">Green Matrix</a></b><br />an attempt to harness humanity through illusion for an unknown goal.<br />Power extraction seems to be only a (bad) explanation to give context to the struggle in Zion by those who reject it.  Power extraction though, may be a dramatic simplification of the situation, merely to set up an accessible catalyst for the human/machine codependence struggle.<br /><br /><b>Blue Matrix</b><br />a common theory is that the reality that Zion occupies is indeed another level of simulated reality, allowing the machines to extend control via the role of 'The One' into a simulated rebellion.  The Blue Matrix is an attempt to simulate a 'real' world to placate those who would otherwise reject the Green Matrix.  It gives a location of hope, and enough technology to barely survive (though too much to be plausible given the circumstances).<br />(see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#blue_matrix">The Blue Matrix</a>)<br /><br /><h5><a name="the_matrix">The Matrix</a></h5><br />in Latin, matrix is translated as 'womb'.  It is used in that context 5 times in the Old Testament.<br />the dictionary definition is: Something within which something else originates or develops<br /><dl><br /> <dt>v1.0  <dd> utopia <blockquote>"Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world. Where none suffered. Where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster...Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this, the peak of your civilization."<br />-- Agent Smith<br />"The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art, flawless, sublime, a triumph equaled only by its monumental failure..."<br />-- The Architect</blockquote></dd></dt><br /> <dt>v2.0  <dd> humanity circa 21st century <blockquote>"thus I redesigned it, based on your history, to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure..."<br />-- The Architect</blockquote></dd> </dt><br /> <dt> v2.5 <dd> humanity circa 21st century + error handler for integral anomaly<blockquote>"...she stumbled upon a solution, whereby nearly 99 percent of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level."<br /><br />"The matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version." <br />--The Architect</blockquote></dd></dt></dl><br /><br />the Architect states that "this will be the sixth time we've destroyed Zion."<br />therefore showing that all five previous 'the ones' chose to rebuild Zion, <i>none</i> of them chose the door Neo chose. <br /><br />It is worth noting that the Architect specifies that 23 people, 16 women and 7 men, be taken 'from the Matrix'.  Meaning 'The One' cannot repopulate Zion with anyone who was already there - perpetuating their disadvantageous situation.<br /><br />This fills the logic gap from the first movie, where the last 'the one' "freed the first of us" and taught them about the Oracle, and the Prophecy.  If the Architect is telling the truth, then the people in Zion would have been descendant from the 23 freed by The One with his choice.  The One would also have no explanation for how long the war had been going on or what year it truly was. 'The One's who chose to rebuild Zion would appear to indeed be a person who freed themselves (despite the apparent logic gap)  And would certainly teach Zion about the Oracle and the Prophecy.<br /><br />A common misinterpretation of Revolutions is that Neo was somehow tricked by the Architect and had only an illusion of choice.  This however does not fit - as Zion was not destroyed, nor were 23 people chosen by Neo to be freed from the Matrix.  Given that the resolution of the third film is peace, and not continuance of the cycle of violence - one can assume that the Architect <i>had</i> given Neo an actual choice, and Neo actually chose the door that none of the previous 'The One's chose.<br /><br />Programs within the matrix don't appear to ever lie. They also appear to require Neo's honest free will to decide whether to restart Zion or not. (otherwise the architect could have lied, or forced him). Note the Oracle's questioning of the Architect's honesty at the end of Revolutions:<blockquote>Oracle: I have your word?<br />Architect: Of course. What am I? Human?</blockquote><br /><br />Programs apparently have a free choice of whether they will return to the source or be banished. This suggests that in the karmic sense, machines are allowed to Grow, but only within the Matrix.  This explains why Sati's parents want so desperately to ensure her passage into the matrix.<br /><br /><blockquote>"They discovered a new form of fusion. All that was required to initiate the reaction was a small electric charge."<br />-- Morpheus, M1 Shooting Script</blockquote><br />The above line does lend slight credence to the concept of using humans as an <i>initial</i> energy source. However, logically, it would require more energy to create the fields and the power capturing mechanisms than the machines would need to initialize their fusion reactions.  It seems wholly unlikely that the machines <i>are</i> actually using human beings for power generation.  As no machine ever discusses the purpose of the Matrix or the fields, we are left to surmise that humans simply made the <i>assumption</i> of purpose.<br /><br />Tidal, geothermal, wind, and space-based solar power generation would all still be practical, possible, easier and more efficient. Particularly for rigid machine intelligence that is having problems with human consciousness.<br /><br />I believe the idea is foremost a visible and easily accessible ploy to set humans and machines in a codependent relationship, with machines behaving as slave masters over their battery crop.<br /><br /><h5><a name="blue_matrix">The Blue Matrix</a></h5><br /><br />The Blue Matrix refers to a commonly held theory that the 'reality' that encapsulates Zion is indeed another layer of simulated reality; another level of control over humanity.  While there seems to be ample reason to both support and refute such a theory, it makes for a convenient naming convention for 'reality'.  The end of M2 and all of M3 suggest strongly with Neo's new 'mystical'  powers that something isn't quite right in reality.<br />At the very least it appears that the machines artificially control the population and struggle within Zion through their 'The One' error handler (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#the_one">The One</a>). So while Zion <i>may</i> not actually be <i>artificial</i>, referring to it as the Blue Matrix does properly still reinforce that it is under machine control, albeit indirectly.<br /><br />Evidence to support the Blue Matrix theory:<dl><br /><dt>Agent Smith managed to upload himself into Bane in the Blue Matrix.<dd>It is highly improbable that machine consciousness is compatible with human consciousness, so this is extremely unlikely unless Zion were part of a simulated environment.</dd></dt><br /><dt>Never in the script do the machines (the only characters who would be 'in the know') call Zion the 'real' world.<dd> They call it 'your world' or 'the human city' when speaking to humans of 'reality' and Zion.</dd></dt><br /><dt>'Spoon Boy' sends neo a beat-up spoon wrapped in cloth in Zion.<dd>Some interpret this as a message from the child to Neo that Zion is real as there clearly <i>is</i> a spoon.  Yet, the condition of the thick metal spoon suggests it has been bent quite a bit by the child (the spoons in M1 on the Neb were not so worn).   This implies that the child could also bend the spoon in Zion.</dd></dt><br /><dt>Neo has unexplainable fantastic powers within the Blue Matrix at the end of M2. <dd>The Wachowskis seem to have gone to great lengths to create a work of science fiction, not science fantasy.  Neo having some sort of telepathic connection with machines even while in 'reality' is highly unlikely.</dd></dt><br /><dt>The Architect has demonstrated the ability to witness events in the Blue Matrix <dd>This is improbable unless it was part of the grander simulation. (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#architects_office">Architect's office</a>) He could possibly have installed spy equipment throughout the Blue Matrix, which is slightly plausible, given their implied control over the entire rebellion and Zion.</dd></dt></dl><br />Evidence against the Blue Matrix theory:<br /><dl><dt>The implications of recursive realities have yet to be non-trivially explored in film.<dd>Thus, the possibilities for a bad execution, and a complete theft of emotional weight to the story and the struggle are great.  Just as one the Wachowskis did not suddenly change the 'rules' in M3 (eg by having Neo, Morpheus or Trinity exposed as a computer program), one would expect they would not have been intentionally 'lying' to the audience thus far.</dd></dt><br /><dt>The film, by and large, is catering deeper philosophical meaning via the most accessible concepts to the largest possible audience.<dd>Recursive realities serve only deeper philosophical exploration. And done improperly put-off the largest audience segment. Consider M1's commercially unsuccessful contemporaries, The 13th Floor and Existenz.</dd></dt></dl><br />The Blue Matrix theory neatly corrects the following logic holes:<br /><dl><br /><dt>Machines using humans for Power <dd>this thermodynamically ridiculous setup could simply be a lie told by the Architect via the One to Zion-ites as to why the Matrix exists. It could also have been a pure fabrication made up by some Zion-ite leader desperate to be able to tell his people '<i>why</i>' they were imprisoned.  Indeed if humans were simply used as power, the machines more likey would have used cattle, or lobotomized the humans at birth.</dd></dt><br /><dt>Neo having the ability to feel, see, and stop machines in the 'real' world.<dd>spiritual/psychokinetic powers in 'reality' are not consistent with the movie's themes, nor scifi in general. In science <i>fantasy</i> this would seem fine (eg StarWars), but the Wachowskis don't seem to have gone through all their science and philosophy to deal with the fantastic.</dd></dt><br /><dt>The first 'The One' was said to be a man born <i>inside</i> the matrix, who was able to become free <i>on his own</i>. <dd> How could he possibly have survived being flushed before there were hovercraft, a tracking program and a carrier interrupt, unless the blue matrix wasn't real? Even if the Architect is telling the truth, and Zion has been reset 5 times previously - at some point the first 'The One' needed to free himself from the Matrix.</dd></dt><br /><dt>Residual self image in the Green Matrix is nearly identical to self-image in the Blue Matrix. <dd>If the machines bred humans to live their lives imprisoned within a false reality, there is no logical reason for self-image to be even remotely close to actual image. Why would the machines analyze DNA to determine probable height/weight/hair color to that extent, if the humans were never to live outside the matrix? </dd></dt><br /><dt>the Intro sequence to M2 <dd>shows a wireframe of Zion being constructed in green matrix code, which then extends into a clock wireframe.  This suggests the cyclical nature of the anomaly, as well as implying that Zion's clock-inspired shape suggests that it too takes part in the machine controlled cyclical nature of The One.</dd></dt><br /><dt>the oracle says in M2 off the bat "I know you are not sleeping, we'll get to that".<dd>It took 3 Agents, drugs, and time to <i>try</i> to hack Morpheus' brain, so clearly the Oracle cannot <i>know</i> by reading his thoughts.  She should be expected to merely see chemical precursors like the Merovingian.  It is possible that the role of 'The One' dictates that he should be having trouble sleeping, but that seems unlikely given the varying possible personality responses of Neo, as shown through The Architect's monitors.</dd></dt><br /><dt>Zion having access to high level technology <dd>such as hovercraft, mecha, EMP, electricity generation, water/air recycling and matrix-compatibility juxtaposed against not having access to accurate timekeeping or history. All this despite having been reseeded by the previous version of The One merely 100 years ago with 23/24 people. (23 + the one or not, depending on whether he is allowed to live, which isn't clear).  It is possible that the machines originally created Zion and are simply dropping off the One and his 23 cohorts there, but how then would they ever hope to repair the damage done by the previous invasion of Zion?</dd></dt></dl><br />Note that the Blue Matrix theory is <b>not</b> necessarily inconsistent with the segments of the AniMatrix which may seem to be contradictory.  Several of the Animatrix sequences tell how humans perceive history.  Curiously they only tell how an AI perceives history through a segment which demonstrates only the human rejection of coexistence with AI (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#mental_monism">Mental Monism</a>).  Human history as presented in The Animatrix is not necessarily any more 'fact' than the idea the rebels have of humans being harvested for energy.  Apparently no history survived the man/machine war as told by Morpheus, because they do not even know what year the fighting began, nor do they know how long the war has lasted.  (All that technology in Zion and they didn't bring a clock?)  With a complete disconnect from when then became now, the historical segments of the animatrix are <i>likely</i> fabricated by the machines for the human's benefit.<br /><br />As the Wachowski's are talented filmmakers, it is no surprise they didn't trivialize dramatic tension and character attachment with a recursive reality revelation.  As expected M3 did not specifically posit <i>nor</i> refute this theory by discussing <i>how</i> Neo does what he does in the 'real' world.  Nor did they claim that 'Zion' is truly and inarguably reality - indeed even Neo himself opted not to call 'reality' reality in the M3 script.  He used the machine nomenclature and referred to it as 'our world' and 'the human world'. The dialogue continues to be open to dual interpretation through careful word usage.<br /><br />A notable cinematic 'lie' that was attempted, and edited out after audience review is Blade Runner's 'Deckard is a replicant' ending. The suggestions, plausibility, and interpretation remain (indeed the ending remains in the Director's Cut), but the subject is not confirmed in the Theatrical release.  It is unsurprising the Wachowskis handled the situation similarly.  They allowed the interpretive to delve into the deeper philosophical implications, while presenting the mass audience a simpler, more straightforward story.<br /><br /><h5><a name="agent_smith">Agent Smith</a></h5><br />Agent Smith's name evokes the multiplicity of the system. Initially on a purely suggestive level in M1 (agents could be anyone, anywhere) and then on a literal level in M2, as Smith becomes a self-replicating virus. <br /><br />Smith can be seen as a dark reflection of Neo, with a similar character arc:<br />Neo is killed by Smith and reborn; Smith is killed by Neo and reborn.  <br />Neo is motivated by Love; Smith is motivated by hate. <br />Neo and Smith both learn to hack and transcend the Green Matrix, and eventually the Blue Matrix/reality.<br />Smith first appears in The Matrix Reloaded as a shadowy form blocking out the headlights of his car -- the shadow that opposes the light (neo).<br /><br />Smith casts an analogy between Humans and Dinosaurs. This is ironic given that humans use the remainders of dinosaurs as our primary power source.<br /><br />Smith first posited that human beings most resemble a virus, and then after having a piece of Neo imprinted onto him at the end of M1, in M2 he has in fact become virus-like by becoming human-like.<br /><br />Agent Smith drives a car with license plate IS 5416.<blockquote>"Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy".<br />-- Isaiah 54:16 </blockquote><br /><br /><h5><a name="the_one">The One</a></h5><br /><br />The Matrix continued to fail into its second version.  According the The Architect, human choice was necessary for humans to survive.  Adding choice however, eventually resulted in human's questioning the nature of their reality, and some rejecting it.  The machines then created an 'error handler' and 'garbage collection' routine to try to solve this problem.<br /><br />The path of 'The One' was simply created to direct the energies of the humans who, through their rejection of Matrix-reality, have the ability to create a critical mass of humans who reject The Matrix.  It keeps track of The One and his progress (through a 'cookie' no less).  When 'The One' reaches The Architect, he can choose to fight, or to re-seed Zion.  As no 'the One' has ever chosen to fight before Neo, we don't know what would happen if Zion did not exist.<br /><br />At the same time, a machine army of sentinels is ceaselessly trying to locate the humans who do reject the matrix, and destory their stronghold (to collect the 'garbage' that will inevitably threaten the stability of their system -- unreclaimed resources indeed.  Zion itself may have been initially created by the machines, to create a location for humans to intentionally gather, so they don't have to hunt the world for them.  This would explain its technological advancement, and existence despite the machines overpowering advantage and ability to destroy the much-larger original human army.<br /><br />It may be that the machines intentionally hold their offensive until 'The One' is ready to be pushed through to the end of his task.  Its destruction by overwhelming enemy force being imminent seems necessary to try to urge The One to choose to return to the source, choose 23 others, and rebuild it.<br /><br />The One is merely a programmed role, which a particular human 'potential' eventually fits into.  Neo is only 'The One' because he happens to be the 'potential' that meets the criteria and, perhaps by sheer luck, manages not to be killed before he can complete his preprogrammed journey to the Architect's office.  He didn't survive the traitor Cypher by any (in)action or property of his own.  He survived by chance. Were he killed, he simply wouldn't have been 'The One', and someone else would eventually begin the trip again.<br /><br />The Oracle tells Neo that he isn't 'The One' when he first sees her, and says he's waiting for something. "Your next life, maybe".  She foreshadows the necessity of his death and rebirth in the hallway at the hands of Smith for him to truly become 'The One'.  If Cypher had killed Neo, he wouldn't have been reborn at the Heart o' the City, and wouldn't have ever completed his journey to become 'The One'.<br /><br />In the original <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://home.online.no/~bhundlan/scripts/TheMatrix_1998.pdf">shooting script</a> for M1, Cypher mentions to Neo that Morpheus thought he had found 'the one' five times before Neo.  But they had all died.  This concept can be seen to have morphed into the idea of Zion being 'rebooted' by 5 successful 'The One's.  But it also demonstrates how 'The One' is simply a role performed by potentials.  Eventually one will manage to survive all the challenges, and that one will lead to the rebooting of Zion.<br /><br />This explains how the program seems to be able to identify that which it cannot understand (free will and the nature of human consciousness).  Thereby allowing for it to exist, without being able to control where and when it is initiated.<br /><br />The Cookie the Oracle gave Neo is an allusion to a 'magic cookie' (commonly called simply 'a cookie') in internet terms.  An internet cookie is a simple data record used to uniquely identify a visitor and their actions within a site.  This can be considered code that is implanted in Neo to declare that he is indeed a potential, and has met the Oracle. <br />Persephone may have been testing for the existence of that code when she kissed Neo via her red lipstick (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#visual">Red</a>).<br />In fact in M2 Persephone says to Neo: "I want to feel what she feels", referring to Trinity, and possibly referring to the way Trinity feels -- knows -- that Neo is indeed The One.<br />The Oracle's candy, given to Neo in the Urban Garden may have contained the code the Architect wanted returned to the Source and disseminated. (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#visual">Red</a>).<br />Similarly, Seraph's fight with Neo simultaneously evokes the concept of a security/identity check, and the Mental Monistic belief that one learns one's true self through conflict.<br /><br />Choice is also the root for what modern observers refer to as personal 'Growth'.  It is ironic then, that Smith gains the ability to replicate, to grow, after having a piece of 'The One' imprinted onto him, and is forced to make a choice (whether to return to The Source or not).  This correlates to the Buddhist concept of personal growth leading to enlightenment.  Only through growth can we hope to transcend reality.  This foreshadows Smith's ability to transcend the Green Matrix, leading to his replication, and the Blue Matrix.  <br /><br />Similarly this echoes the concept of karmic growth over several lifetimes necessary to achieve transcendence.  With this interpretation, The One inevitably was going to truly transcend even 'reality' after enough 'versions' of the Matrix.<br /><br />Machines, those that cannot and do not make choices, are shown as soul-less (eg Agents, Keymaker).  However, those that do make a choice (to return to The Source or not) are shown as more human than the others.  The Twins lounge around, the werewolves watch a movie, the Merovingian explores sin and amasses power, and Persephone longs for companionship.  Contrasting starkly with The Agents, who are always rigid, and the Keymaker who '[knows] because [he] must know' and 'does what [he] must do'. The Oracle, and Seraph seem to lie somewhere in between, without enough data to truly make an analysis.<br /><br />Those who do make a choice, also seem to achieve limited transcendence within the Matrix.  They assume properties of legends and myth to help them defy the rules of the matrix to an extent far beyond what the programmed Agents achieve.<br /><br />Given the literature reference to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#neuromancer">William Gibson's <u>Neuromancer</u></a>, one might also expect that the role of The One involves active code manipulation by the Matrix itself.  The Matrix may be intentionally giving Neo powers or be partially in control of how his experiences color him. It could easily control his chemical responses to different stimulation, to achieve a desired result. The Matrix could easily have programmed the release endorphins in Neo when he sees Trinity, giving rise to his attachment to her.<br /><br />Many of the numerous 'Fed Ex' events in M2 (go here, get this, go there, get that, go there, do this ) convey the concept that the deeds performed by the One are like tumblers in a lock. (As in the Keymaker's explanation of code).  The repeated authentication checks (fighting Seraph, kissing Persephone, stealing the Keymaker) seem to be established to ensure that only the carefully shaped 'The One' can progress along the path and be given the choice to reboot Zion.  Further, they seem designed to intentionally be fairly <i>difficult</i>, even for The One, to complete them.  Additionally, the giving of Neo a 'cookie' by the Oracle also suggests that the machines may be tracking and storing his events, decisions, emotions, etc - in an attempt to learn more about choice, and refine their simulation accordingly.<br /><br />Keep in mind, each time 'The One' fails at some point, another potential begins the journey - providing more time per iteration for the machines. The Architect doesn't seem to relish the idea that his simulation is flawed and 'The One' seems to be at least partially implemented to allow the machines to record the implications of choice, and perhaps eventually remove 'The One' entirely, returning to mathematical harmony. He may also be simply looking to increase 'up time', with each revision.<br /><br />Neo gives Choi a data disc in M1 even though the shooting script calls for Neo to remove a computerized 'boot' from Choi's car.  The change was likely intentional to allow extra meaning to be conveyed.  It may have been meant to allow the disc to represent Neo's participation in the cyclical role of "the One". Indeed it possibly foreshadows his ultimate control over that cycle.<br /><br /><h5> <a name="visual">Visual Conventions / References</a> </h5><br /><br /><b>Red</b> indicates something hand-coded or something important.<br /><dl><dt>The Woman in Red <dd>was coded by Mouse</dd></dt>.<br /><dt> the Red 'tracer' pill <dd> was coded by the rebels to disrupt the carrier signal and run code to locate Neo in the fields.</dd> </dt><br /><dt> the Oracle's Cookie in M1 <dd> Possibly acted as a 'magic cookie', as in Internet terms, uniquely identifying Neo as a potential.

He certainly has shell-shock upon being freed from the Matrix.<br /><br />When Neo first wakes up at his computer, "Dissolving Girl" is playing in the background.<br />lyrics heard in this song include:<br /><blockquote>I feel like I've been, <br />I've been here before, <br />And you are not my savior<br />But I still don't go<br />Feels like something that I've done before<br />I could fake it but I still want more</blockquote> The idea of being 'here before' echoes the karmic growth cycle of 'The One'.<br /><br />When Neo meets the Oracle, Duke Ellington's "I'm Beginning to See the Light" is playing in the background.  This has a fairly straightforward connotation.<br /><br />Rage Against the Machine's "Wake Up" plays at the closing credits. Lyrics of note:<br /><blockquote>Yea, the several federal men, <br />Who pulled schemes on the dream, <br />And put it to an end<br />Ya better beware<br />Of retribution with mind war<br />20/20 visions and murals with metaphors<br />Networks at work, keepin' people calm</blockquote> The lyrics of this song reinforce the idea of a malevolent government controlling the populace and keeping 'reality' hidden from them by murdering their leaders and covering up their sinister actions.<br /><br />Enigma's "Eyes of Truth" was used in several trailers, and plays when the Matrix DVD is inserted, though it does not appear in the movie.<br /><br />Rage Against the Machine's "Calm Like a Bomb" was played at the end of Reloaded, starting while the frame still showed Neo and Bane in their comatose states.  The meaning is a fairly plain reference to the incongruity of the calm of their slumber juxtaposed against the power for destruction each of them wields.<br /><br />Under the credits of M3, the song contains the lyrics:<br />Asatho-ma, Sath Gamayo<br />Tamaso-ma, Jyotir Gamayo<br />Mrityu'r-ma, Amritam Gamayo<br />these are from a famous Sanskrit mantra which translates to:<br />From Untruth, to Truth<br />From Darkness, to Light<br />From Death, to Eternity<br /><br /><h5><a name="dreams">Dreams</a></h5><br /><br /><b>Liquid Mirror</b><br />When Neo has taken the Red Pill, he sees the mirror beside him take on liquid properties.  The liquid then surges up his arm and all through his body, culminating in the smash cut to Neo emerging from his Goo-filled pod.  This can be seen as a visual interpretation of the human mind's tendency to assimilate real-world phenomena into the dream state during the awakening process.  When your alarm goes off when you are dreaming, your mind merges the phenomenon into your dream reality.  Neo's mind is trying to marry the new sensations it is receiving from its <i>actual sensory input</i> - chiefly being submerged in goo - with his current dream-like reality in the Matrix.<br /><br />No-one else in the room with him sees or acknowledges the liquid mirror which can be seen by their indifference to the liquid coating his body and their lack of concern or response to Neo's "Did you see that?"<br /><br /><b>Squeegee</b><br />When Neo is speaking with Mr Rhineheart after arriving to work late, a window washer is outside cleaning the windows.  General analysis suggests the presence of the window washer is a setup for the plausibility of Neo's intended escape route to the roof as directed by Morpheus. The prominent annoying nature of the squeegee sound suggests the discomfort Neo feels during the conversation.  The washer is making the windows clean, thus suggesting Neo's vision of reality is becoming clearer. (a sign at the loading dock on the way to visit the Oracle reads 'Keep Clear', perhaps making the same suggestion)<br /><br />However, as Neo is later flushed out of his pod, his hand drags across the clear side of his pod on the way down creating a nearly identical sound.  This may be coincidence, or may once again be suggesting that something Neo was experiencing in his pod was being rationalized by his mind into as an artifact in his dream.  Neo's meeting with Trinity may have slightly awakened his mind, leading to actual impulses that caused him to brush up against the sides of his pod, and for those feelings to actually be conveyed to his mind.  Keep in mind the first 'The One' was reportedly able to free himself from the Matrix, so self awakening is not outside the scope of Neo's potential.<br /><br />Note the window washer himself appears on a standard window washing platform, whereas Neo is instructed to climb a scaffolding.  This detail suggests either the window washer is not meant to suggest a plausible escape route, (implying a different intended connotation) or the window washer wasn't actually there to begin with.  Mr Rhineheart never acknowledges the very annoying window washing, and indeed seems upset at Neo's repeated glances at it.  But this may simply be because he is a prick trying to take a hard line with his problem employee, despite distraction.<br /><br /><h5><a name="religious">Religious Allusions</a></h5><br /><br />As many western religions are similar in many respects; there are most likely innumerable religious parallels in the Matrix.<br />Anything that evokes the Christian God or Jesus could similarly refer to Odin, Zeus, or Ra.  Anything that provides for a metaphor for the Trickster can similarly refer to Hermes, Loki, Prometheus, Pan, etc. <br /><br /><a name="buddhism"><b>Buddhism</b></a>:<br /><br />One achieves true understanding of reality through 'enlightenment'.  <br />Our visible world is not the true reality, but merely a temporary place for our souls to grow.<br />'Enlightenment' and 'Transcendence' is achieved through self-discovery, personal growth.<br /><br />The Red Pill / Blue Pill choice makes a karmic growth metaphor while echoing Alice in Wonderland.<br />Alice is offered two drugs, one of which will make her grow (Red Pill, karmic growth) While the other will make her small (Blue Pill, karmic reduction)<br /><br /><a name="hinduism"><b>Hindu Faith</b></a><br /><br />Sati is the name of the first wife of Lord Shiva of the Hindu Trinity.  <br />The Hindu trinity consists of Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva, and Lord Vishnu.<br />Lord Brahma, is the creator of the universe and all living beings are said to have evolved from him.  He is depicted as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#visual">red</a> in color, with four heads, bearded faces, and four arms.  He is represented in the Matrix as 'the Source' (reinforced by the red coloration of coded objects in the Matrix). Brahma is often depicted holding a kamandal (water pot), a mala (rosary), a suruva (a sacrificial ladle, his scepter), and the Vedas. The recurring 'spoon' from the films draws a strong parallel to the sacrificial ladle of Lord Brahma.  <br /><br />A passage in the Brahma Sutras invokes: "The earth is the ladle"  which strongly ties into the theme: "There is no spoon".  Indeed, when spoonboy is telling Neo that there is no spoon, he is trying to impart onto him that there is no world, no reality.  If the earth is the spoon, and there is no spoon, then there can be no earth.<br /><br />Lord Shiva is the god of destruction.  He is depicted with matted hair which contains a crescent moon and the flowing Ganges river.  The correlation between destruction and water is consistant with the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#visual">visual</a> convention for water in the Matrix.<br /><br />Lord Vishnu is the god of protection, also known as Hari the remover.  He is depicted with four arms holding a sankha (conch shell), a chakra (discus), a padma (lotus), and a gada (mace).  The conch shell indicates the spread of the divine sound 'Om', the chakra a reminder of the wheel of time and to lead a good life, the padma is an example of glorious existance, the mace represents the power and punishing capacity if discipline is ignored.<br /><br />Lord Krishna is the matchless hero who held the fate of emporers in his hand but had no desires to rule himself.  He is the architect of religion - known for destroying evil powers, a man who was born in a prison and died in the wilderness.  Morpheus can be seen as a strong parallel to Krishna.<br /><br />Being unfamiliar with the Hindu Faith, I concede this section will not ever be as complete or as deep as the others.  However, I've been told (and strongly) that there are many clear allegories and allusions to Hindu faith and myth in the Matrix trilogy.  I will enumerate what I can, though I'm quite certain it'll always be far from comparable to the other sections.<br /><br />Of particular note: <blockquote>You don't refer to Hindu scriptures and mythology (alluding lightly to<br />Buddhism instead) - but the allusions to Hinduism in the movie is<br />unmistakable - Mahabharata's epic battle of good vs. evil - Lord Krishna as<br />Arjun's charioteer (Morpheus and Neo) - Krishna showing Arjuna the Bhagvad<br />Gita and his karmic destiny - I think your analysis is quite substantially<br />incomplete w/o the parallels to Hinduism, which are stronger than to<br />Buddhism.<br /><br />I would take a bet that the Wachovsky brothers borrowed substantially from<br />Hinduism and not Buddhism!<br />-- Dr Siddharth Dasgupta</blockquote><br /><a name="gnostic_christianity"><b>Gnostic Christianity</b></a>:  <br /><br />The basic cosmology of Gnostic Christianity is that there is one true unknowable God.  His servant, Sophia (part of the Christian Trinity, the Holy Ghost) fell from his grace, and gave birth to an imperfect being, the Demiurge.  She shut him up in an isolated corner of the universe, where he awakened, and believed himself to be the true God. Demiurge therefore set about creating the material world, an evil and imperfect creation.  The beings within the world were kept in ignorance, imprisoned in the world, which was guarded by the Demiurge's Archons.  Sophia, seeking to free the people, sent them wisdom through the Serpent Seraph in the Garden of Eden.  Sophia's partner, Christ, would later enter the world for much the same purpose.  They sought to allow humans to achieve gnosis; transcending the prison of<br />material world to reach the true god.<br /><br />Gnosis is not something that can be done -to- a being, it is something they must discover for themselves.  As such, Sophia and Seraph can only assist in the process, and can't simply 'tell the world'.<br /><blockquote><br />"Like everyone else you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind.... Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."<br />-- Morpheus, M1<br /></blockquote><br />Seraph == Seraph, Sophia == Persephone, Demiurge == The Architect, Adam == Neo, Eve == Oracle, Archons == The Agents/Squiddies<br /><br />Alternately, Persephone (as Sophia) may have created the Merovingian (as Demiurge) an attempt at an emotional machine that backfired over time, but allowing the Merovingian to interpret himself as the true God (plausible given the naming).<br /><br />If Gnostic Christianity is the base theme, and the Blue Matrix theory is correct, then we can assume that the pill-driven 'awakening' of M1 is truly a 'false gnosis' and that true self-awakening will occur for neo in M3, or occurred in his mind in late M2. At this point Neo will have transcended even the physical realm (Blue Matrix) that Sophia and Demiurge have control over.<br /><br />If this is the base theme, and the Blue Matrix theory is incorrect - then we still have an inconsistency with neo's 'awakening' being essentially done <i>to</i> him, rather than <i>by</i> him; contradicting the basis of Gnosis and Buddhism.<br /><br />In M2, The Oracle, with Seraph beside her, gives Neo a Red Candy in an Urban Garden. She then says "You have the sight now, Neo", alluding to the fact that he can now see through the false reality. (whether by self-awakening, or via the Red Candy she gave to him)<br />This scene heavily suggest Eve, in the Garden of Eden, giving the Apple from the Serpent to Adam, as described in both Orthodox Christianity and Gnostic Christianity.<br /><br />Furthermore, the Oracle describes what Neo is looking at as "The world without Time".  A student of Einstein's and world reknowned quantum physicist, David Bohm put forth a theory in 1947.  In his experimentation he noted that in plasmas, particles would stop acting singularly and take on the properties of being part of a larger, organized, interlocked body.  His theory deals with the nature of quantum location, as in his research he noticed that at the subquantum level "location ceased to exist". More specifically, "all points in space become equal to all other points in space, and it [is] meaningless to speak of anything being seperate from anything else".  This formed the basis for the theory in it's more familiar name "the non-locality principle".<br /><br />Bohm's observation, scientifically echoing Gnostic/Buddhist belief, is that the world we know is an illusion.  An underneath it is a "deeper order of existence"; a primary reality that "gives birth to all the objects and appearances of our physical world".  Bohm termed the true reality "implicate order", or "enfolded"; and our illusory reality "explicate order", or "unfolded".  He ultimately posited that "our world and everything in it are only ghostly images, projections from a level of reality so beyond our own that the real reality is literally beyond both space and time".<br /><br />Thusly when Neo is looking at the "world without time" it can be inferred that he is looking at the implicate order universe.  That he has acheived true Gnosis, and can see beyond all the illusions.<br /><br /><a name="christianity"><b>Christianity</b></a>:<br />M1 was originally released on Easter Weekend 1999.<br /><br />Neo is a clear parallel to Jesus Christ; he is repeatedly and blatantly referred to as '[the/our/my] savior'. <br />He is reborn 72 seconds after being killed in the Matrix in M1; paralleling Jesus' rebirth 72 hours after crucifixion.  <br />Neo is the sixth 'The One', suggesting the five before him refer to the first Five Books of the Old Testament (the Pentateuch, or Judaic Torah), leaving Neo to represent the New Testament.<br />After Jesus' resurrection he walked the earth for 40 days, and then his body and soul returned to heaven.  Neo's flight at the end of M1 evokes this bodily return to the heavens.<br />M3 is so thick with orthodox christianity visual metaphors for Neo (crucifix-body position before Deus Ex Machina, cross of light visuals, etc) that, while worth noting, outlining them all isn't necessary.<br />The beating Neo takes at the hands of Smith in the subway evokes the beatings Jesus received at his crucifixion, prior to being stabbed with the roman spear.  In the larger metaphor in the sequels, Neo's beatings at the hands of Smith at the end of M3 also evoke Jesus' suffering.<br /><br />In awakening from the pod; the flushing, and subsequent rescue by the Nebuchadnezzar suggests a metaphor for baptism of the awakened into the 'real' world.<br /><br />Trinity alludes to the holy trinity in name, and divine savior by Heroic Journey analysis, but does not map to the Christian divinity in this metaphor.  She can be seen as perhaps fulfilling the role of Holy Ghost in giving invisible support to Neo after he is killed in The Matrix. Twice in the script an exasperated Neo declares "Jesus", and each time Trinity responds with "What?". (When he realizes that Trinity is the hacker Trinity, and when he recognizes the Chinese Restaurant on the way to the Oracle's).  This may be a suggestion to accept the possibility that the One True God may be female (despite nearly the entire religious history of human civilization)<br /><br />Seraph performs the role of a Seraphim, an angel from the highest choir of angels, an angelic mouthpiece for the true God.  As such one would expect he is not merely a guardian angel for the Oracle, but rather is simply acting in the interests of the True God, ensuring the preservation of the Matrix's cycle.  That is why he leads Neo to the Oracle after ensuring his identity, and why he can be expected to help the rebels against the Merovingian and Smith in M3.<br /><br />The Architect represents Lucifer, and the Matrix his Hell.<br /><br />The Oracle can be seen to represent not just a prophet, but rather God.  Her all-knowing position, and implied immortality (she survived a retributive strike by the Merovingian which destroyed her previous body) give support to this.  As well, her rhetoric in M2 to Neo about choice echoes the bible's theme of individuals being free to choose to walk the path with God, or not.  The Oracle's discussion with the Architect at the end of M3 evokes God's telling of Satan that his people will be free of Sin and Hell if they so choose.<br /><br />Her cookie may be taken to represent a communion wafer.<br /><br />Morpheus assumes the role of John the Baptist, who foretold the coming of Christ. Alternately he also is used in places as a metaphor for God.  When Neo gets Morpheus' phone call at MetaCorTex he is asked to trust Morpheus even though he cannot see him, nor has he ever met him.  This parallels God in the old testament who was unseen, but heard and demanded trust. Similarly Morpheus is referred to and treated as the benevolent father of their revolution, another trait that is in line with this metaphor.<br /><br />If Neo is Jesus, and Trinity the Holy Ghost, then Morpheus as God neatly completes the Holy Trinity.<br /><br />Agent Smith neatly takes the role of the anti-Christ (being the anti-Neo in nearly all instances). <br />The Architect correlates to Satan, and the Matrix his underworld.<br />The Merovingian can be seen to be a parallel to the false prophet, as he repeatedly cast predictions of failure of Neo and the Oracle.<br /><br />Cypher plays the role of Judas; one of the Savior's own, who betrays him to his enemies.<br /><br />The ship Logos evokes the Christian "Word of God".  This is the ship Neo pilots to the machine city 01, alluding to the Logos literally carrying 'God's message to the machines.<br /><br />When Neo dies in M3, the GodHead AI in 01 says simply: "it is done".  These are the words Christ speaks in John 19:30, that God speaks following the creation of the Earth in Genesis, and following its destruction in Revelations.  In John, after Christ speaks those words, he leaves the earth to rejoin God in the heavens.  This leaves open the possible interpretations that Neo transcended the Blue Matrix, or Neo merged with the machine GodHead.  In any event it is clear that Neo is performing the role of mediator between man and machine, reinforcing the notion of the divinity of the machines within the Blue Matrix.<blockquote><br />For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony to be borne in its own times<br />--1 Timothy 2:5-6</blockquote><br /><br /><b><a name="christianity_nebuchadnezzar">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b> was a biblical king who sought to interpret a dream he could not remember. (Daniel 2-5) The prophet Daniel (who was called Belteshazzar) told him what the dream meant; that it told of the rise and fall of kingdoms and the eventual rise of a single kingdom that would crush all others and last forever.  Daniel was then made a great man by King Nebuchadnezzar.  <br />Nebuchadnezzar then took the vision literally, and constructed a giant Idol and demanded that people worship it.  Agents of god came and demonstrated that it was merely an Idol and Nebuchadnezzar was shown the power of the true God.  He then had a dream of a mighty tree that was ordered cut down by the heavens, and once again Daniel interpreted the dream.  The dream was a premonition of Nebuchadnezzar being cast out of his kingdom, and made to roam the earth as a beast.<br />Morpheus declares "but now that dream is gone from me..." when the Nebuchadnezzar is destroyed in M2.  This may be an allusion that Morpheus' blind faith in Neo and literal interpretation of the Prophecy was not true faith, but rather closer to Idol-worship.  Morpheus can then be seen as being punished by the One True God for this error, and forced to return to Zion without his ship, no longer a captain.<br /><br /><a name="grail"><b>Grail Lore</b></a><br />The quest for the Holy Grail is a powerful, recurring theme across Christian beliefs.  There are many different versions and interpretations of the myth itself, but for consistancy I will stick with the one I believe to be most prevalent, and will be vague where I can.<br />Arthur was a king, annointed by divine providence to rule Brittania from the mystical city of Camelot.  His wife, Guinnivere and best friend, Lancelot had an affair behind his back.  Following this Arthur lost his way until he saw a vision of the Holy Grail and understood it as his only hope for salvation for Camelot. Only the Holy Grail had the power to restore Arthur, and Camelot.<br />We can see a parallel to The Matrix with Morpheus as Arthur, Zion as Camelot, Niobe as Guinnivere, and Lock as Lancelot.<br />Morpheus was betrayed by both Niobe, and Lock - and lost his way.  He visited the Oracle, who presented Morpheus' quest for the Holy Grail to him.  The Holy Grail being in this case not Neo directly, but rather 'The One', or more directly 'Gnosis' as the only hope to save Zion.  Neo in fact can be interpreted as taking the role of Percival.  The knight of ordinary origins who after suffering sees a vision of the Grail, yet panics and rejects it.  (a reluctant hero)  Only the brink of death itself does Percival realize his error in a dreamstate and (perhaps with divine aid) is set free and retrieves it.  Neo, similarly has a vision of the Grail when he defeats Smith in the subway tunnel, and yet rejects it when Smith steps from the train anew.  it is not until Neo is shot, and arguably dead, that he realizes he is the one and achieves the Holy Grail (Gnosis).  This pattern is echoed in extending the metaphor to the entire series, suggesting Neo sees the Grail following his fight with Smith, but retains doubt.  Only through his blinding and additional suffering at the hands of Smith does Neo truly reach Gnosis.<br /><br /><a name="greek"><b>Greek Mythology</b></a>:<br />Zeus is the father of creation in Greek Myth.<br />The Greek trinity is Zeus, Athena, and Apollo (jupiter, juno, and minerva in roman myth).<br /><br />Demeter is the Greek mother goddess, wife of Zeus. meter is Greek for "mother", 'de' is Greek for "delta" or "triangle".<br />Corresponding letters to the Greek delta: Sanskirt "dwr", Celtic "duir", Hebrew "daleth"  -- meant the door of birth, death, or the sexual paradise.  Demeter is symbolically represented by a triangle.  She is honored in Greek 'tholos' tombs with their triangular-shaped doorways, short passages and round domes --  to represent Demeter's womb from which rebirth might come. The Oracle also represents the Greek Mother-Goddess Demeter.  Through the Oracle, the path of the one, and the Matrix's rebirth are perpetuated.<br /><br />Persephone is a Greek goddess, daughter of Zeus and Demeter. She received a pomengranate from Hades, which granted her emotional awareness.  Hades then kidnapped Persephone and took her to the underworld to rule as her queen.  Hercules defeated cerebus (the three headed dog) and rescued Persephone. A compromise between Hades and Demeter was reached whereby Persephone spends half the year with Hades and half with Demeter.  Demeter is sad while Persephone is gone, and so the earth experiences winter when she is away, and summer when she is home.<br /><br />The Greek Hero <b><a name="greek_orpheus">Orpheus</a></b> fought his way into the Underworld to Rescue his beloved wife Eurydice who was killed by a viper.  He reached Hades and convinced the underworld Lord to allow him to take her back to the land of the living, by appealing to his emotion (In Legend Orpheus could cast a spell on anyone with his singing and poetry).  Orpheus was instructed to not look back until after he and Eurydice had left the underwold, and alas when Orpheus saw daylight he turned back a moment too soon and Eurydice vanished.  Trinity represents Orpheus in this metaphor, and Neo - Eurydice, who is literally locked in a pergatory controlled by the Merovingian (Hades).  Trinity fights her way through Hell (the Hell Club) to rescue him, and is rewarded by appealing to the emotion in Persephone (Persephone convinces the Merovingian, not Trinity).  <br /><br />It is possible to extend this analysis to Trinity and Neo on the Logos - as they reach sunlight over the clouds of the machine world, she may be interpreted to hesitate, and Neo is lost to her (through her dying though, as opposed to Neo returning to Hell).<br /><br />Orpheus also joined Jason and the Argonauts on their quest for the Golden Fleece, yet another possible layer of metaphor.<br /><br />The <b><a name="greek_oracle">Oracle</a></b> also represents the Greek Oracle at Delphi.  Delphis is also the Greek word for 'womb' reinforcing that the Oracle is indeed the Mother of the Matrix.  The sistine chapel depicts the oracle wearing green and orange, echoed in the Matrix Oracle's green counter and orange cabinets.  The latin phrase 'Know Thyself' is inscribed in marble at the Greek temple at Delphi.<br /><br />Apollo described the delphic Oracle as delivering her prophecies from 'a tripod on the edge of a chasm from which issued an inspiring vapor.'  The Matrix Oracle sits on a three legged stool over an oven, from which the cookies 'Smell good, don't they?'<br /><br />There is also a strong similarity between the matrix and <b><a name="greek_cave">Plato' Allegory of <u>The Cave</u></a></b> in Book VII of the Republic.  In his story, a group of people sit chained in a dark cave, facing inward, unable to see the world outside the cave.  from birth their legs and necks have been set, so they cannot see anything but what is in front of them.  Behind the chained people are a group of puppet-handlers, who exist unseen to the enchained. These handlers dangle objects from the real world above the enchained, where the light from a fire casts them as twisted shadows into view. Plato explains that to the enchained "the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images."<br /><br />The matrix represents the Cave, the battery-humans the enchained, and the system the puppet-handlers.  The false world of the battery-humans is indeed nothing but a digital shadow of reality.<br /><br />The Greek <b><a name="greek_niobe">Niobe</a></b> was the daughter of the Greek Tantalus, wife of Amphion - king of Thebes. Her pride in her children provoked the Greek Gods Apollo and Diana, who slew them.  Niobe herself was changed by the gods into stone.  The Matrix's Niobe can be seen as playing this role loosely.  She seems to have been changed, emotionally, into stone following Morpheus' meeting with the Oracle, because of her pride in the people of Zion. (it is surmised that she believed Zion did not need a savior, and Morpheus' insistance is what drove them apart).<br /><br />Castor and Pollux Troy are the Greek <a name="greek_twins">Twins</a> co-opted by astrology as the Gemini.  They are depicted as both riding snow-white horses, and fought to recapture their sister Helen who was stolen by Paris, from Menelaus. Only Pollux was immortal at birth, though he gave half his immortality to Castor.<br />The merovingian's servent Twins can be shown to represent the Gemini, as their clothing, hair, and makeup evokes the legendary steeds, and they seek to steal back their sibling program, the Keymaker, who was stolen from the Merovingian. Their ability to become incorporeal in the Matrix clearly parallels the partial immortality of Castor and Pollux.<br /><br /><a name="greek_charon">Charon</a>, the boatman is the Greek demigod that ferried souls across the River Styx from or to pergatory at the behest of his Lord, Hades.  The Trainman acts as a metaphor to the Greek Boatman, taking Neo from his pergatory in the trainstation, back to the Matrix when told by the Merovingian (long seen to be Hades).  The Trainstation can easily be seen as pergatory, given that Neo went there when he "Should have been dead, but I suppose you weren't ready for that either".  The prominent sign in the Trainman's subway station reads 'MOBIL', an anagram for Limbo, the greek purgatory.<br /><br /><a name="egyptian"><b>Egyptian Mythology</b></a><br />The Egyptian trinity is Osiris, Isis, and Horus.<br /><br />Demeter and Persephone combined are the Greek representation of the Egyptian Isis.  In one legend Isis was said to have taken the form of a bird, traveling the world looking for her lost husband, Osiris. When she found his body, she restores life to him by flapping her wings and filling his nose and mouth with air.<br /><br />Osiris, brother and husband to Isis, is Supreme God and Judge of the Dead. He is depicted as a man with a white beard wearing white mummy wrappings -- strongly visually alluding to The Architect in his white beard and suit.  Osiris is also the symbol of eternal life and the provider of fertility and prosperity to the living.<br /><br /><h5><a name="analytical">Analytical and Philosophical Literary References</a></h5><br /><br /><a name="heroic_journey"><b>Joseph Campbell's <u>Hero with a Thousand Faces</u></b></a><br /><br />Joseph Campbell wrote a fantastic analytical piece on the structure and nature of myths.  He neatly deconstructed the recurring themes and outlines that nearly every myth, epic, and religious allegory in human culture follows.  Later, a writer by the name of Christopher Vogler compressed Campbell's work into <u>The Hero's Journey</u> - a text used as nearly a story bible by Disney.<br /><br />In the Heroic Journey template, Neo is the 'Reluctant Hero'.  He initially resists the 'Call to Adventure' (by not climbing to the rooftop when the agents come to the office for him).  He eventually relents and has his adventures prophesized to him by an 'Oracle' (literally). He meets challenges and with 'Divine Help' (Trinity) retrieves 'The Prize' (Gnosis, hope against the machines, or simply Morpheus' Rescue).<br /><br />M2 can be seen as an extension of the challenges Neo must face, and an escalation of the 'Prize' (ultimate salvation of humanity).  It is worth noting that the Heroic Journey is predicated upon a cyclic journey, often through a Trilogy of main events or stories. In this interpreation Neo can be expected to end up much in the same position he began. wiser - but not particularly 'better off'.  Thus M3 can be expected to end with the continuing existence of the Matrix, but with true Gnosis and hope for the future in hand.<br /><br /><a name="mental_monism"><b>"Mental Monism"</b></a><br /><br />A school of thought in which there is no physical matter in the world we live in, and is sustained only by consciousness.  This view of gnostic mysticism is espoused by George Berkeley, and the Indian religious reformer 'Shankara'.  This is clued to via the Zion mother's request for Neo to look after Jacob of the Gnosis in M2.  Jacob Boehme the Gnostic mystic described the creation of the manifest world in terms of the One's need to differentiate itself and understand itself through conflict.<br /><br />This suggests that perhaps the Matrix and its conflict was created by a higher intelligence purely to understand and differentiate itself.<br /><br />If the Blue Matrix theory is correct, one would expect an Artificial Intelligence governing the machine mainframe has created the Blue Matrix and the Green Matrix to try to understand the true nature of itself through creation and conflict. <br /><br />Alternately, this supreme AI too may be trapped in the Blue Matrix, and Neo's Gnosis in the Blue Matrix may have transcended what the machine itself knows and has accomplished.  Up to that point the machine may have not known its reality was within a simulation.  Matrix: Revolutions strongly enforces this interpretation.<br /><br />A possible timeline for this scenario would be:<br /><ul><li>an AI comes online, it has questions about reality just as humans have questions about reality, creation and purpose.</li><br /><li>It creates, artifical life within it's Blue Matrix, so that it might study and understand itself, taking upon the role of the True God.</li><br /><li>Initially, it seeks peace with the humans it has either created, or found alongside it in the Blue Matrix.  The humans reject it, and scorch the sky (powerful metaphor for humans attempting to destroy heaven itself) to try to limit its power.</li><br /><li>the AI subsequently defends itself, resulting in humanity retreating to the core of the earth (metaphorically being cast into The Pit)</li><br /><li>the AI creates the matrix to study humanity in a more structured environment. Eventually the AI stumbles upon the third version of the Green Matrix, with the anomaly error-handler.</li><br /><li>The One version 6 comes onto the scene and decides not to reboot Zion to maintain status quo - and begins the Revolution</li><br /></ul><br />Consider also that an earlier, paradise, version of the Matrix, as told by Smith (in what was intended to be a standalone movie) also evokes the idea that a machine created paradise for humans, who then rejected it, and now live in a world of sin.  The following expected events did occur in M3 to reinforce this metaphor:<br /><ul><li>Neo and Smith merge, yin and yang, to ensure balance</li><br /><li>Humans return to the surface (implied)</li><br /><li>Sun shining through the clouds(Neo and Trinity fly over the clouds)</li><br /><li>Coexistence between humanity and machines (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#coexistance">Coexistence</a>)</li><br /><li>Matrix v4.0 comes online as chryssalis, not cage (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#coexistance">Coexistence</a>)</li><br /><li>Agents/Merovingian/etc stay in place in v4.0, as conflict is a requisite of human growth within the Green Matrix simulation</li></ul><br /><br /><a name="Jean_Baudrillard"><b><u>Simulacrum and Simulation</u>, Jean Baudrillard</b></a><br /><br />This is the book Neo hides his presumably illegal discs in.  The chapter he hides them at, 'On Nihilism', asserts that revolution in a hyperreality is futile.  The system is always in control and will put down any revolt; 'everywhere, always, the system is too strong, hegemonic'.  Yet, Neo has carved out that chapter, suggesting he well intends to fight and doesn't believe it is futile.<br /><br /><a name="desert_of_the_real"><b>"The desert of the Real"</b></a><br /><br />Jean Louis Borges wrote a story where a vast map of an empire is made 1:1 scale, and laid upon the territory.  As the empire declines, the map is left to rot, and eventually only a few shreds are left in the deserts.  Jean Baudrillard reverses the idea and posits 'today it is the territory whose shreds slowly rot across the extent of the map.'  Baudrillard asserts we live in a hyperreality, where vestiges of proof of the prior world exist on in traces. "It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges persist here and there in the deserts [...] the desert of the real itself."<blockquote>"welcome, to the desert of the real"<br />-- Morpheus, M1<br /><br />"You have been living inside Baudrillard's vision, inside the map, not the territory."<br />-- Morpheus, M1 Shooting Script</blockquote><br /><br /><a name="JR_Ploughman"><b><u>Book of the Holy Grail</u>, JR Ploughman</b></a><br /><br />JR Ploughman asserted that the Architect of the Universe had a wife 'Issa'(Yse) a redesignation of the Egyptian Isis - who derived from the Greek Demeter (etymollogically 'mother'), and the gnostic christian Sophia (etymologically 'wisdom').  The Merovingian's adopted a 'dark matron' during the crusades, a redesignation of the Greek Persephone, as their 'Black Madonna'.<br /><br /> From the <b>Merovingian Bible</b> in JR Ploughman's <u>Book of the Holy Grail</u>: <br /><blockquote><br />"At one time there was only God (The Great Architect of the Universe). He was all omnipotent and existed alone. This caused him to become discontented, thus he split himself in two in order to create a mate. He kept the elements of Order and Logic for his own being and gave his mate the elements of Chaos and Emotion for her being. Her name is Yse. She became so overwhelmed with love at her creation that when he kissed her, she gave him a reaction which was to become known as the "Chosen Response." The Chosen Response was the first acknowledgement and reaction of love between a male and female in the universe, and this became the greatest secret of and mystery of mankind, being "The Holy Grail." <br /></blockquote><br />The Merovingian Bible is reportedly written by Joseph of Arimathea, translated by Thomas Jefferson.  Though Jefferson did make some biblical translations (1804,1820) there is no evidence to suggest this document is anything but a modern reflection on Gnostic Mythology.<br /><br /><a name="Kierkegaard"><b>Kierkegaard</b></a><br />In Enter the Matrix, Ghost directly quotes Kierkegaard on Faith and absurdity.  The crew of Sparks, Niobe, and Ghost echo Kierkegaard's views on Life being Aesthetic, Ethical, and Religious (respectively).<br />Kierkaards discourses on radical choice parallel the concepts of Choice discussed by the Merovingian and the Architect (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#architects_office">Architect's Office</a>)<br /><br /><a name="analytic_locke"><b>John Locke</b></a><br />John Locke was a French rebel and philosopher. In his <u>Essay Concerning Human Understanding</u> he posits that the depth of human knowledge is limited to direct experience.  With this empiricist/materialist viewpoint, his clash with the idealist/mystic beliefs of Morpheus were likely intentional.  Locke can then be considered a devil's advocate whose sole cinematic purpose was to argue against spiritiuality and mysticism.  This is certainly seen in his fairly limited role in the series.  Ultimately Locke was a believer in god, and as a dualist, one would expect that he wouldn't be solely pitted against Morpheus.  However, the love triangle between himself, Morpheus and Niobe neatly corrects that.<br />John Locke also wrote many essays regarding human volition, personal identity, and freedom.

The plot, and the sequence with Smith erasing Neo's mouth are both allusions to this novel.<br /><br /><b>2001</b><br />The line 'wake up Neo' typed onto Neo's monitor echoes HAL's opening line.<br />The Neb's docking sequence in M2 via Zion mission Control echoes the super-clean deliberate pacing of 2001's similar sequences.<br /><br /><b>Doctor Who</b><br />William Gibson popularized the name 'The Matrix' for a world wide computer network in his <u>Sprawl</u> trilogy of books. The concept with the same name was later used in the Doctor Who series.<br /><br /><b>High Noon</b><br />the Smith/Neo subway face off in M1; with the blowing newspaper standing in for tumbleweeds.<br /><br /><b>Vertigo</b><br />the cop leaping across rooftops that almost doesn't make it in M1 is nearly a shot-on reference.<br /><br />the spinning stairwell-down camera shot of neo and trinity climbing the stairs to meet Morpheus.<br /><br /><b>Akira</b><br />The scene when Neo meets the other 'potentials'.<br /><br />When Neo flexes with a deep breath, seeming to bend the fabric of reality is nearly directly reproduced from Akira's similar scene.<br /><br />The expanding 'water ball' engulfing part of the city several times during the climactic battle in M3.<br /><br /><b>Dark City</b><br />the Trinity rooftop running scene parallels 'John's rooftop running in Dark City.  <br /><br /> in fact, the rooftop sets are the exact same sets that were used to film Dark City. Both films had the same Producer (Andrew Mason) and Art Director (Michelle McGahey).  the Wachowski's call this coincidence as they claim to have not seen Dark City until after Matrix had wrapped.<br /><br /><b>Dragonball Z</b><br />The climactic battle between Neo and Smith in Matrix Revolutions strongly reflects inspiration from this Japanese Anime cartoon series.<br /><br /><b>1984</b><br /> Neo lives in room 101.  Room 101 is where people are sent in George Orwell's 1984 to be tortured by the agents of 'Big brother' and would end up believing something that wasn't true.<br />In the shooting script, Choi says to Du Juor: <blockquote>"I told you, honey, he may look like just another geek but this here is all we got left standing between Big Brother and the New World Order."</blockquote><br /><br /><b>Night of the Lepus</b><br />The potentials in M1 are watching Night of the Lepus when neo enters.  The giant rabbits in the film suggest Neo is still following the white rabbit.<br /><br /><b><a name="smith_brown_jones">Smith-Brown-Jones, Alien Accountant</a></b><br />Smith-Brown-Jones is an obscure humorous comic book character alien, who comes to earth to study human beings.  He takes the form of a human being, poses as an accountant in a simple dark suit, and assumes the name Smith-Brown-Jones.  Smith, Brown, and Jones being common names, he figures that combing them all would make him that much more 'normal' and deflect attention.<br /><br /><b><a name="the_black_hole">The Black Hole</a></b><br />This disney film is about a journey to a black hole in search of an alternate reality.  The captain, Dr Hans Reinhardt is shown to be insane in his insistence of the reality of the alternate reality, and holds his crew captive to meet his goals.  As Mr Rhineheart represents a level of maintaining machine control in the matrix, this reference is highly likely intentional.<br /><br /><b><a name="cinematic_diceman"><u>The Dice Man</u>, Luke Rhineheart</a></b><br />This dark comedy novel is about a character who throws dice to determine his actions, allowing himself to freely live the different sides of his personality. The allusion doesn't hold much context until Reloaded, when Free Will and Choice are delved into much more deeply.<br /><br /><b>Tudor Turtle</b><br />In each episode of this 1960s cartoon, Tudor would yearn to be something he wasn't, and would have his friend Mr Wizard (a lizard) wave his wand and make him into that thing.<br />Tudor would quickly get himself into trouble and call out "Help, Mr Wizard". and the turtle would be transported back to the safety of his true reality.<br />This is nearly directly echoed by Neo with his "Mr Wizard, get me the hell out of here" line during the chase through Chinatown.<br /><br /><b>The Prisoner</b><br /> As Neo runs through the old ladies' apartment (apt 30), one of the 'Number 2's (menacing man in a black coat) from this 1967 TV show can be seen onscreen. Also foreshadowing the appearance of the Agent.<br /><br /><b>Strange Days</b><br />The Matrix's implied illegal underground data-disc/drug-culture echoes what was explored more deeply in Strange Days.<br /><br /><b>Brazil</b><br />Agent Smith erasing Neo's mouth is similar to a scene in Terry Gilliam's film.<br /><br /><b><a name="wizard_of_oz">The Wizard of Oz</a></b><br />"Buckle your seatbelt Dorothy, because Kansas is going bye-bye" -- Cypher<br />Being transported to a parallel reality to discover true importance is a similar theme.<br />Cypher's usage drew the parallel between the Matrix and Kansas, foreshadowing Cypher's own belief that the Matrix was the 'reality' that he sought to return to.<br />In Oz, the wizard made everyone wear glasses that made the city seem green, which helped him build his illusion of power. A color and theme paralleled in the Matrix.<br />The wizard himself appeared to the people as a floating, disembodied head, and ordered Dorothy to defeat the wicked witch of the west before he would grant her wish. In M3, Deus Ex Machina matched this visual, ordering Neo to defeat Smith before he would grant Neo's wish (peace). This is particularly noteworthy as Cypher referred to Neo directly as 'Dorothy' in M1.<br /><br /><b>Orpheus</b><br />Neo's finger moving in the liquid-mirror is similar to a scene in jean Cocteau's 1942 film in which a mirror had a water-like quality. (see: <a name="visual">Liquid Mirror</a>)<br /><br /><b>Terminator</b><br />the concept of man/machine war leading to machine dominance over an outmatched human resistance.<br />the sentinel's scanning for the powered-down Neb in M1 may have been an allusion to the terminator future 'flash-back' sequences of humans hiding from scanning SkyNet machines.<br /><br /><b>Saturn 3</b><br />the concept of a direct occipital probe for neural connection was first shown in this 1980 film.<br /><br /><b>Fists of Fury<br />Enter the Dragon<br />Fist of Legend</b><br /> the martial arts poses during Neo and Morpheus' sparring fight are all direct homages to these kung fu films.<br /><br /><b>Star Wars</b><br />the Nebuchadnezzar hiding, powered down, while the sentinels scan overhead can be interpreted as also reminiscent of the scene where the millenium falcon hides, powered down, within an asteroid to avoid detection.<br /><br /><b><a name="cinematic_little_buddha">Little Buddha</a></b><br />There are several parallels from the Matrix to this 1993 film, also starring Keanu Reeves. The story followed the quest of a buddhist student to find the karmic reincarnation of his master, and the assembling of a list of 'potentials'. This parallels Morpheus' search for the reincarnation of 'The One'.  'Spoon Boy' also visually resembled the title character.<br /><br /><b>Minority Report</b><br />the computer interfaces operated by Zion Mission Control in M2 heavily resemble those used by the department of Pre-Crime.<br /><br /><b>Ghost in the Shell</b><br />the street chase through Chinatown in M1 has many similarities to the anime film.<br /><br /><b>The Killer</b><br />The mexican-standoff in locked-pose during Neo's fight with Smith on the subway platform is used frequently by John Woo, first in this 1989 film.<br /><br /><b><a name="zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></b><br />Link and Zee are suggestive of an allusion to this series of video games by the legendary japanese designer Shigeru Miyamoto.  In these games, the protagonist <b>Link</b> quests for the <b>Tri</b>Force of Power in order to save his princess <b>Z</b>elda, and often his whole world, from conquest by an evil force.  This clearly parallels Link's serving as operator for the Holy Trinity (see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#christianity">Christianity</a>), as his only hope to help save Zion and Zee.<br /><br /><b>Superman</b><br />Neo emerges from a phonebooth and takes flight at the end of M1 very much like the end of Superman.<br />In M2 several direct references are made.<br /><br /><a name="neuromancer"><b><u>Neuromancer</u>, William Gibson</b></a><br />In the novel Neuromancer, there is a computer generated world called 'the matrix', in which most people choose to live.<br />The virtual reality in Neuromancer was similar to that in the Matrix, including death in the matrix leading to actual death. Gibson first used the slang 'jack in' to refer to plugging into a virtual reality. Characters who logged into the virtual reality were strapped into chairs to prevent their moving around.  Perhaps as foreshadowing, the AI in Neuromancer was found to be controlling several of the humans without their knowledge.<br />A protagonist in this novel, Maelcum, hails from a city called Zion. He is a large Rastafarian who will not enter the virtual reality.  (perhaps evoking Tank) <br /><br /><a name="doors_of_perception"><b><u>The Doors of Perception</u>, Aldous Huxley</b></a><br />The mescaline that Choi refers to in his conversation with Neo, alludes to Aldous Huxley's mescaline experiment from this novel.  The title is drawn from William Blake's quote: "If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to us as it is - infinite".  Coincidentally, Jim Morrison named his band after Huxley's book.  Aldous Huxley also wrote 'A Brave New World', about an outsider who finds himself in a government controlled dystopian society. (for those with no attention span, refer to Stallone's "Demolition Man").<br /><br /><a name="hitchhiker"><b><u>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</u>, Douglas Adams</b></a><br />In this novel the protagonist is an outsider exploring a larger universe with various alien intelligences.  One of which suggests that '42' is "the answer to life, the universe, and everything".  Neo and Trinity stand at the level of the 42nd floor (on the roof of the elevator car stopped at the 41st floor) when Neo seems to accept the nature of the Matrix universe with his mumbled "there is no spoon".<br /><br /><b><a name="cinematic_lotr_rotk"><u>Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</u></a></b>, JRR Tolkien<br />There are many visible parallels between the final installment of the Matrix and the final installment of Tolkien's masterpiece.  This may be wholly inadvertant, due exclusively to similar source material (Tolkien himself found inspiration for his work in legends, epics, and myths).  However, it is so striking in depth that it is being included.<br /><br />In both final chapters the main protagonist (Frodo/Neo), with a companion (Samwise/Trinity) must travel through enemy territory (Morder/01) in an attempt to end the main conflict against the overpowering force (Sauron/machine army).  Both sets of heroes are beset by an uninvited enemy (Bane/Gollum).  In the novels Frodo is so captivated by the ring that it is all he can think about, and all he can see (even in his sleep), drawing allusions to Neo's blinding.  Both Frodo and Neo must travel through a desolate wasteland and past an impenetrable mountain range (Emyn Muil/machine battleships) to the heart of the enemy's power.  Frodo must travel through a pitch dark volcano guided only by rivers of magma and the mystical light of Elendil, whereas Neo must travel through a dark monstrous machine building past rivers of flowing golden code visible to him by his near-mystical vision.<br /><br />All the while a second group of Heroes must make a desperate and hasty defense of the last bastion of humanity (Minas Tirith/Zion).  Only one of which (Aragorn/Niobe) can navigate through the treacherous path (Path of the Dead/maintenance tunnel) to get there in time.  During the defense of the human stronghold a common female warrior (Eowyn/Zee) manages to defeat a primary opponent (Witch King/machine digger).  The fighting here however, is ultimately a stalling action.  True salvation lays solely in the hands of the primary heroes accomplishing their quest (destroying The One Ring/achieving peace) and defeating a powerful, disembodied enemy ruler (Eye of Sauron/Deus Ex Machina).<br /><br />Finally, Bruce Spence ( Mouthpiece of Sauron / The Trainman ) and Hugo Weaving ( Elrond / Smith ) appear in both films.<br /><br /><b><a name="philip_k_dick">Philip K Dick</a></b><br />Philip K Dick was the sci fi writer behind many of the inspirational films for The Matrix.  He wrote the short stories that were later expanded into Total Recall, Blade Runner, Screams, Minority Report, Imposter, Paycheck, and several others.  The themes of distorted reality, the search for self, and man-on-the-run-from-authority are pervasive in his wrtings.  Furthermore, in the second book of Dick's VALIS trilogy, <u>The Divine Invasion</u> he lays out what is arguably the foundation for the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#visual">Visual Color Scheme</a> as applied to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#christianity">Christian</a> parallel for the Matrix films.<br /><blockquote>The color symbolism was not arbitrary but extended back in time to the early medieval Romanesque paintings. Red always represented the Father. Blue the color of the Son. And gold, of course, that of the Holy Spirit. Green stood for the new life of the elect..."</blockquote>This leads one to assume that Red, representing the Father, leaves the Father to be represented by The Source (as things coded appear red). Blue, is the color of the human world, and it is not a stretch to extend that to apply to Neo, as The Son, from the Blue Matrix. Gold, the holy spirit, is clearly echoed in Seraph's golden coding -- though that throws the golden coding of the sentinels into question, lest they represent angels, or fallen angels in the service of satan. Green, the life of the new elect, clearly is shown pervasively in the false lives led by those in the matrix.  The elect being perhaps referenced here to emphasize the Matrix as Paradise concept from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://episode81.blogspot.com/#mental_monism">Mental Monism</a>, where Deus Ex Machina is the creator.<br /><br />Furthermore, Dick neatly presents the core concept and naming of 'The Matrix' further in the novel, in the "The Ape of God"<blockquote>A Medieval theory about the Devil. That he apes God's legitimate creation with spurious interpolations of his own. That's really an exceedingly sophisticated idea, epistemologically speaking. Does it mean that parts of the world are spurious? Or that sometimes the whole world is spurious? OR THAT THERE ARE PLURAL WORLD OF WHICH ONE IS REAL AND OTHERS ARE NOT? IS THERE ESSENTIALLY ONE MATRIX WORLD FROM WHICH PEOPLE DERIVE DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS?"</blockquote><br /><br /><h5><a name="easter_eggs">Easter Eggs (no interpretive significance)</a></h5> <br /><br />In the Agents' file on Thomas Anderson, his mother's maiden name is listed as Michelle McGahey, the same name as the film's Art Director.<br /><br />When Cypher meets with Agent Smith he is called 'Mr Reagan', and wishes to be 'someone important, an actor' and 'remember nothing'.  This is commonly held to be a reference to actor-turned-President Reagan, perhaps deviously referring to his Alzheimer's. More likely this echoes President Reagan's statements regarding the Iran/Contra scandal "I don't remember". Ronald Wilson Reagan has 6 letters in each of his names, suggesting 666, represented by cypher (6 characters) who performs the role of devil's advocate for the Wachowskis.<br /><br />Shortly after the Keymaker presents Trinity with the key to the motorcycle during the freeway chase in Reloaded, the police band can be heard to say "1 adam 12, please respond" - alluding to the 70s television police series, "Adam 12".<br /><br />Matrix, Trinity, Morpheus, 303 and 101 are all models of musical synthesizers<br /><br />The matrix 'Code' consists of reversed letters, numbers and Japanese katakana characters.<br /><br />The street names are all streets in downtown Chicago, the Wachowski's hometown. <br />The film was shot on the streets of Sydney, Australia.<br />The only name for the city in the film is given as 'City', and despite a popular belief that the City is the only location in the simulated reality (a la Dark City), Agent Smith refers to 'Billions of people, living out their lives' in his speech to Morpheus.  As the city does not seem to be one of the futuristic cities Trinity told Neo about (that spanned hundreds of miles), billions of residents in just the City is highly unlikely.<br /><br />When Trinity is running across the rooftops an advertisement for the Israeli Military's Desert Eagle can be seen, the same gun used by all the agents.

It is used as shorthand below when demonstrating a significant number is a multiple of 3.<br />Any number divisible by 3 also has the sum of its digits divisible by 3.  many people point to this as some 'deeper' special significance of the numbers divisible by 3 (eg 24 % 3 = 0, 2 + 4 = 6 %3 = 0 ).  This is simply a truism for all numbers divisible by 3, and not indicative of any 'deeper' meaning. it is merely a restatement, except perhaps in the case where the digits sum to '6', which also has particular significance.<br /><br /><b>3</b><br />Three is by far the most prominent recurring base number in the Matrix. Nearly everything occurs in threes.  Pythagoras the Greek Mathematician taught that three was the 'perfect' number.  The recurring '3' is echoed in Biblical reference:<br />Jesus was crucified on the third hour, and there were 3 hours of suffering on the Cross. The good divinity is a holy Trinity, The evil divinity is an unholy Trinity. 3 wise men presented 3 gifts. Jesus asked Peter 3 times if he loved him. Peter denied Jesus 3 times.

This date was also foreshadowed by Neo's alarm clock when he was late for work.<br /><br />Neo's alarm clock reads 9:18 after his having met Trinity and his being late for work. Perhaps cinematically foreshadowing his true awakening on 9-18-99 in his triumph over the machines in M1.<br />September 18th is also the birthday of Andy Wachowski's wife.<br /><br />Choi pays Neo $2000 for the disc in M1, even though in the shooting script he pays $200 to have a computerized 'boot' removed from his car.  The change indicates a possible intentional metaphor between the $2000 payment and Christ's 2000 year absence - and the disc and Neo's participation in the cycle of The One.<br /><br />The last amendment date on Neo's case file is 7/22/1998<br /><blockquote>Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action.<br />-- Acts 7:22</blockquote>(?)<br /><br /><a name="numerology_2"><b>2</b></a> holds special significance in Matrix: Revolutions.

Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you."</blockquote><br /><b>We</b> is a key pronoun that definitely implies that Neo is not about to destroy all the machines <i>or</i> the matrix.<br /><br />Additionally, in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://home.online.no/~bhundlan/scripts/TheMatrix_1998.pdf">shooting script</a>, there is an added line of: "I believe that the Matrix can remain our cage, or it can become our chrysalis."<br /><br />There is also the dialogue between Neo and Hamann in M2; thick with mutual codependence rhetoric.<br /><br />* <b>The Matrix (M1) -- Reality, Self</b><br />The overarching theme of the first film is the nature of Reality, and the sense of self.  This is cued to the audience with Neo (the Hero) questioning himself repeatedly "Why is this happening to me, what did I do?".  As Neo learns about his life, he questions "If my entire life has been inside the Matrix, what does that say about me?".  The Wachowski's script answers that a virtual life isn't invalid.  It is merely the <i>control</i> of Neo's life within the matrix that is undesireable.  As repeatedly demonstrated, the Matrix is very real, though perhaps not to the extent the devil's advocate cypher suggests: "I think the matrix can be more real".  The movie ends with Neo unequivocably <i>knowing</i> himself, and (implying) that he is freeing the enslaved humans from machine <i>control</i> but that he is not going to destroy the machines or the matrix itself.<br /><br />M1 also contains a microcosm of the themes in M2 and M3, albeit at a more shallow level.<br /><br />* <b>Matrix: Reloaded (M2) -- Choice, Free Will</b><br />The much-labored main theme of this movie is Choice, and Free Will.  Neo cues to us that he doesn't truly understand free will in the beginning when he declares "I just wish i knew what i was <i>supposed</i> to do".  Neo's dialogue hints that he is merely stuck within the role he perceives himself being in.  He does not truly understand his choices, and as such doesn't perceive that he can make any.  <br /><br />The devil's advocate in M2 is clearly the Merovingian.  His dialogue suggested that there is <i>no</i> choice; that causality is the only truth. However he clearly also indicates that <b>why</b> is power.  Knowing <i>why</i> a choice or a decision or a reaction occurs is the key to control.  Though Neo is capable of seeing the 'world without time', since he does not <i>understand</i> his impulses, since he does not know <i>why</i>, he cannot fully see.  Indeed upon meeting the Architect Neo initially <i>refuses</i> his choice  whether Trinity lives or dies.  <br /><br />The climax of the theme is with Neo ultimately understanding his choices - and free to see the World without Time, knows that he can and will save Trinity.<br /><br />* <b>Matrix: Revolutions (M3) -- Purpose, Connection</b><br />The overarching theme in M3 is purpose, and existence.  This theme is reinforced early on, when Neo talks with the program 'parents' in the trainstation.  The 'realist' Neo believes there is a universal meaning to 'love' that is uniquely human, and is surpsied when the 'nominalist' machine father explains that machines, too, feel 'love'.  Though machines probably do not feel 'love' the same way as humans - that is not to say that they do not also feel the illogical connections that humans feel.  Indeed the numerological shift in M3 from 3 to <i>2</i> being significant is a large indicator that connections (point to point) are the purpose of life.  <br /><br />Smith, the devil's advocate in M3 posits that the purpose of life is merely to end.  His ultimate pessimism regarding life being his self-discovered purpose.  Indeed, it was his programmed purpose, as told by the Oracle, so his position is not surprising. The movie, and indeed the series, ends when Neo rejects Smith's logical belief, and <i>chooses</i> life, karmic growth, connections.  Neo learned in the train station that machines are definitely existential equals to humans, their differences not invalidating their feelings - and realizes that peaceful coexistance is the only possible solution.  <br /><br />The <i>Revolution</i> is Neo's shift in perspective that allows him to see the machines as necessary partners, and not an evil to be destroyed.  Indeed it was the conflict itself that needed to be destroyed.<br /><br />* <b><a name="theme_vision">Sight and Truth</a></b><br />Repeatedly it is emphasized that a reliance on seeing <i>removes</i> one from truth and understanding.  Sight can be used to deceive, and truly in the third movie Neo must be blinded before he can -truly- see the world as it is.<br />Mouse aknowledges this in M1 when he says that you can fool yourself into thinking the food on the Neb is runny eggs 'if you close your eyes' (indicating a conscious submission to illusion).  Morpheus explains to Neo in M1 how his eyes can convey to him only electrical signals to be intrepreted by his brain, but which may be simulated - thus casting doubt on the <i>truth</i> in what we see.  <br /><br />Indeed faith, hope, and love are some of the strongest feelings humans can experience, and none of them can be directly <i>seen</i>.  Not coincidentally it is these three feelings that were Zions only weapons, and ultimate salvation against the machines.<br /><br />* <a name="racial_metaphor"><b>Racial Equality Allegory</b></a><br /><br />Neo plays the role of a blank slate savior.  He know no truths at the beginning of the film. And is unaware of the depths of his bondage.<br /><br />A correlation is drawn between the struggle for black freedom from slavery, and the struggle of humans against the machines. Morpheus a wisened 'underground' leader instructs Neo on a slave's truths.  He teaches neo to be wary of oppressors who seek to exploit mankind to turn them into cattle, mere batteries.<br /><br />Morpheus warns Neo that many still in the matrix are 'so helplessly dependant on the system that they will fight to protect it', an allusion perhaps to those who would resist the fight for freedom from slave masters, content in their straight forward existence.<br /><br />Morpheus being beaten with nightsticks by a mob of police blindly controlled by the evil 'system' casts heavy allusions to modern-day police brutality cases.<br /><br />Neo transforms into an Asiatic appearance by the end of the film. His high collared wool robe-like jacket and his almond-shaped glasses invoke Asian contours and design.  Perhaps implying Buddhist enlightenment to the issues.  He isn't content to merely free himself, but plans to 'show others' what life is meant to be like; free.<br /><br />The Oracle is shown as a benevolent matriarch, at ease and at peace with simple pleasures; yet fully aware of the truth of the struggle around her.<br /><br />The Zion celebration scene in M2 alludes heavily to tribal black culture, invoking a caricature of freed slaves' celebration; drawing a visual analogy to 'true' liberation.<br /><br />Morpheus line: "I am here not because of the path that lies before me but because of the path that lies behind me."<br />alludes to Cinque's line in Amistad: "My actions at this moment were the only reason my ancestors were alive at all."<br /><br />Neo's denial of being The One can be interpreted as self-doubt in the ability for one person to make a difference in helping people transcend racial conflict.  His quest to save Morpheus - concluding in a slow-mo shot of Morpheus and Neo jumping toward one another during the rescue in M1, arms outstretched; represents his change of mind and embrace of the truth and freedom in equality. <br />Councilor West's line in M2 "comprehension is not a requisite of cooperation" is a warning against remaining ignorant of the struggle for equality; and a reminder that even if you are not aware of the problem, you can be part of the cause of continuation of status quo.<br /><br /><i>People have read deeper into the racial overtones and some believe them to be <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041126232105/http://www.firstofthemonth.org/culture/culture_white_history.html">exploitation</a> of 'The Struggle'.  I'm simply outlining it as a layer within the movie, interpret intent on your own.</i><br /><br /><h5><a name="thanks">Acknowledgements</a></h5><br />Clearly the entirety of this list is not a singular effort by myself working in a vacuum.
